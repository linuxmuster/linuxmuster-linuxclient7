Plugins can be used to expand the functionality of the linuxmuster-linuxclient7. The intention is to keep special use cases, like conky or static linking of folders like `Documents` and `Pictures`, out of the main codebase to keep it sleek.  
Plugins consist of hook-scripts which are placed inside the respective folders in `/etc/linuxmuster-linuxclient7`.

**If you have an issue with a plugin, please contact the maintainer directly.**
